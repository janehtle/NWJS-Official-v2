# NEWJEANS Official Website V2 (REACT) - eCommerce Project

Refactored version of first iteration of my NEWJEANS Official Website, but using React (Vite). This is still a work in progress as I am still trying to wrap my head around understanding React fully and slowly converting the first iteration to React.
